> Sass project boilerplate following the ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) methodology

## What Is It?

At [GPMD](http://www.gpmd.co.uk/) we've been using an ITCSS structure for our Sass projects for a while now. If you're interested in finding out more about ITCSS you can [watch this talk by Harry Roberts](http://youtu.be/1OKZOV-iLj4).

For each new project I set up I keep finding myself creating the same directory and `@import` file structure. To speed things up I've generated this repo as a quick and easy starting point.

## What It Isn't

This isn't a Sass framework. There is no actual SCSS or CSS included, it's just a bare-bones directory and `@import` file structure (for now...).
